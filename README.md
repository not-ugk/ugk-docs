Please review our [code of conduct](/codeofconduct-wip.md) and [covid policy](/covid-policy.md) before attending any UGK events.

The list of all current songs is available in the [songbook](/Songbook.pdf). You can also view songs on our [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1R_PdJGCqwTzhDGQVnJXRFb2eMQ4_F3W). However, not all songs are in the playlist. If the songbook and playlist do not match, the songbook is the source of truth.

Check out the [instructions on adding new songs to the songbook](/songguide.md).
