# Covid Policy

In additon to our code of conduct, we also require that anyone attending or organzing our event follow some policies to keep our vulnerable members safe from covid.

## Rule 1: Do not come if you are feeling sick OR were exposed to covid

Easy one, just don't come if you are ill, whether it's covid or RSV or something else

## Rule 2: Always test beforehand

If you are using rapid tests (you can order them for free monthly in Washington at [Say Yes! COVID Test](https://sayyescovidhometest.org/), 
test two days before the event and the day of, as close to the event time as possible.

Getting a PCR test is better and is advised if you have been around a lot of people.
