# Covid Policy

In additon to our code of conduct, we also require that anyone attending or organzing our event follow some policies to keep our vulnerable members safe from covid.

## Rule 1: Do not come if you are feeling sick OR were exposed to covid

Easy one, just don't come if you are ill, whether it's covid or RSV or something else.

## Rule 2: Always test beforehand

Take a rapid test the day of the event, as close to the event time as possible. If you need a test kit we will have some available, which you can pick up prior to the event or use outside of the venue, though you will will not be permitted to enter until the test has finished.

If you've been around a lot of people, please get a PCR test ahead of the event. The [King County COVID-19 resources page](https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/testing.aspx) has a list of PCR testing sites.
