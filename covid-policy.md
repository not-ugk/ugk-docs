# Covid Policy

In additon to our code of conduct, we also require that anyone attending or organzing our event follow some policies to keep our vulnerable members safe from covid and other sicknesses.

## Rule 0: Get your vaccinations

Getting the original two doses of covid is a hard requirement. For your health in general we recommend getting yearly covid vaccine updates, as well as the yearly flu vaccines.

## Rule 1: Do not come if you are feeling sick OR were exposed to covid

Easy one, just don't come if you are ill, whether it's covid or RSV or something else. This includes a waiting a few weeks after getting sick.

## Rule 2: Always test beforehand

Take a rapid test the day of the event, as close to the event time as possible. If you need a test kit we will have some available, which you can pick up prior to the event or use outside of the venue, though you will will not be permitted to enter until the test has finished.

We used to recommned getting a PCR test if you have been around a lot of people, but that's no longer a realistic option.

## Rule 3: Use our microphone covers and don't put your hands in chip bags.

We provide disposable microphone covers that you can re-use throughout the night, plus we arrange our snacks in a way that you can pour out chips and such into plates and bowls, and we always have dips and sauces in squeeze bottles or individual compostable containers.

## Rule 4: Don't share drugs

We're not going to stop you from doing this, but we recommend against it, due to getting people sick at previous parties. We have a lot of smokers and we can come up with a mechanism for you to partake if you really want to, without needing to swap spit with someone.
